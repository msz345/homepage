# Homepage

Personal setup of my homepage, which caused my some headaches due to lacking real world examples.
My homelab consits of a Proxmox cluster, and some docker VMs. In order to not have to many widget visable at the same time, I spilt them up into tabs.
Further I added my family calendar, and some useful bookmarks to the homepage.

## Getting Started

I mainly use Proxmox to host my containers. I used the lifesaving [Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts](https://tteck.github.io/Proxmox/) whos authur saddly passed away. The community took over the project https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/
